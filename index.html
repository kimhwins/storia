				<div class="bold-text">Storia</div> is a web app that helps busy people chronicle their lives as a cohesive story. 
				<br/><br/>I worked on Storia as a personal project for 3 weeks, whenever I had time during the semester. <a href="#solution"><div class="bold-text">Jump to my prototype here.</div></a>

							I used to journal daily! I signed up for a journal service that would email me a reminder every day, and in the evenings I'd take the time to just reflect and write. I really enjoyed having those times of peace and clarity of mind. If I skipped a day, I’d fill it back in within a couple days. 

							<br/><br/>When I hit college, <div class="bold-text">I was so busy</div> that the reminders just started piling up. Every few months, I'd try to write a "catch-up" entry about everything that happened to me so far--events, new people I'd met--<div class='bold-text'>but it would be so long and disorganized that I'd end up giving up.</div>

			<div class="text section-head">Research</div>
			<div class="text section-dis">
				I needed to see if this wasn’t just a me problem! To really understand the problem at hand and how to design the best solution, <div class="bold-text">I sent out a preliminary user questionnaire and looked at existing solutions.</div>
			</div>

			<div class="text section-head-2" id="sevenfivetop">Questionnaire</div>
			<div class="text section-dis">
				In the questionnaire, I asked college students about their journaling habits. I discovered some key statistics, barriers, and habits:

				<div class="text section-head-2" id="sevenfivetop">Benchmarking</div>
				<div class="text section-dis">
					I then looked at existing solutions, their pros and cons, and how they could be applied to Storia. I looked at four different categories of solutions: <div class="bold-text">bona fide journaling apps, writing apps, habit-forming apps, and story planning/organizing apps.</div> I wanted to learn more about how they solved their users' problems.
				</div>
			</div>
		<img id="surrender" src="images/benchmarking1.png">

		<div class="big-margin">
			<div class="text section-dis">
				Afterwards, I came up with lists of features that I thought were most successful and effective for each category of apps.

				<div class="bold-text">Vivian</div> loves photography because it allows her to record the important events and people in her life. She uses journaling as another way to record everything, so she wants to write daily and add photos she's taken.

				On the other hand, as a freshman, <div class="bold-text">Evan</div> is stressed out from hard classes and the new environment. His advisor suggested he use a journal to vent his feelings whenever he's overwhelmed, but he has trouble putting his feelings to words.

			<div class="text section-dis">
				I played with different layouts quickly by sketching out my ideas and scribbling notes. At this point, I focused on just getting any idea I had out on paper, which is why they're so messy! Here are a few pages out of many:

<!-- 		ITERATIONS SECTION STARTS HERE -->

			<div class="text section-head">Iterations</div>
			<div class="text section-dis">
				Throughout the design process, I asked some of the users who had filled out the preliminary questionnaire for their opinions on my work in progress and conducted some A/B testing. Here's a snapshot of just my Sketch iterations for the mini calendar:

		<div class="big-margin">
			<div class="text section-head-2" id="less-margin">Minimalism vs. Comfort</div>
			<div class="text section-dis">
				Early on, <div class="bold-text">I played with a very minimalist design</div> in the spirit of Medium and other distraction-free environments, with a mostly white background and line icons, thinking it would be the best solution for users' concerns about being easily distracted. 

				<br/><br/>After showing it to users, however, I found that while it wasn't distracting, some users said it also made journaling feel less intimate. <div class="bold-text">The white interface was too sterile and empty,</div> and in an ideal world <div class="bold-text">an online diary would feel comforting and friendly</div>--a safe space to express yourself.

				<br/><br/>I added more colors, making the purple accent more prominent, and added more rounded edges. I also made the bookmark button bigger and at the top of the entry, much like where a bookmark would go in a real book.

		<!-- 			ITERATIONS SECTION ENDS HERE	 -->		
			<div class="text section-head" id="solution">Prototype</div>
<!-- 			<div class="text section-dis">
				After my header iterations, I came up with my final solution using the other League sites as a guideline:
			</div> -->
		</div>
		<iframe width="100%" height="700" src="https://xd.adobe.com/embed/5ba71dfe-23c8-49d8-4b7b-02e4b4ca6168-2d96/?fullscreen" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

		<div class="big-margin">
			<div class="text section-head-2">Navigation Bar</div>
			<div class="text section-dis">
				I considered using either a black low opacity bar for the navigation bar or a gradient. I chose the gradient because it was smoother and more immersive--the same reason I went with the gradient for the header. Ideally, the nav bar would only appear on first load of the page and when the user hovers over the top of their page.
			</div>
		</div>

			<div class="row" id="more-padding">
				<div class="column-50">
					<a href="images/header.png"><img id="header-redesign" src="images/header.png" alt="new header"></a>

				</div>

				<div class="column-50 column-50-text">
					<div>
						<div class="text section-head-2 column-head">Header</div>
						<div class="text section-dis column-text">
							The header serves as the first impression players get of the game, so I focused on including the most valuable information according to users as well as making it as immersive as possible.

							<br/><br/><div class="bold-text">Users noted that they considered media, reviews, platforms, and price to be over 4/5 importance,</div> so they were placed prominently in the header, with the key game graphic being the star of the show. Highlighting the key game graphic and making the header 100% the size of the browser was also in an effort to build a more immersive experience.

							<br/><br/>Ultimately, I grouped together actionable items in the bottom left corner and game descriptors like genre and review rating in the bottom right corner.

							<br/><br/>Pictured on left is the sale price, where I used yellow to make it stand out--Steam has sales often!

			</div>
			<div class="big-margin">
			<div class="text section-head-2">Tabs</div>
			<div class="text section-dis">
				A big problem that users had with Steam is the length of the page as well as its disorganization. While I can understand the appeal of not having to change pages, the page forces users to scroll for eons to find what they need, and the information is scattered. 

				<br/><br/>Users also had varying opinions on what they wanted to see most on the page. Accommodating all these preferences, I used tabs to put every type of information on the same hierarchy so users can instantly navigate to what's most important to them.

			</div>
		</div>

			<div class="row">
				<div class="column-50">
					<a href="images/description.jpg"><img id="header-redesign" src="images/description.jpg" alt="game description"></a>

				</div>

				<div class="column-50 column-50-text">
					<div>
						<div class="text section-head-2 column-head">Description</div>
						<div class="text section-dis column-text" id="more-top">
Game description is the default open tab, so it’s a continuation of the first impression that players get to the game. <div class="bold-text">It was really important to include valuable information here not only for the players to get a good gist of the game, but also for the developers to pitch their game.</div><br/><br/>

The current steam page has GIFs dispersed throughout the key features section, so I placed them next to the game summary so users who didn't watch the trailer can still see bits of the gameplay here. <br/><br/>

Other purchasing options are placed in the right column, with game editions more prominent than downloadable content.<br/><br/>

Reviews from reputable sources are also here as part of developers advertising their accolades and prominent good reviews. Users would be able to hover over the 100+ to see a list of awards.

			<div class="big-margin">
			<div class="text section-head-2" id="more-top">Developer Updates & Reviews</div>
			<div class="text section-dis">
				Developer Updates were considered solidly 3/5 in priority on my user research survey, but a fair share of users voted it as a 1 or 2/5--and that's how Steam currently represents it, with only half of the latest developer update visible in the store page. I thought developer updates deserved their own soapbox because they pour so much work into their game and might need to make important announcements to the players, so I provided a tab for them.

				<br/><br/> Reviews were simply updated stylistically to match developer updates and follow Steam's current rating system.
			</div>

			<div class="text section-head">Future Features</div>
			<div class="text section-dis">
				In the future, I'd like to add a lot of the <div class="bold-text">features that Steam currently has,</div> like Community Hub, as well as <div class="bold-text">a way for videos to play in the header,</div> and <div class="bold-text">a place for the game logo to go. </div> Steam is a robust website with a lot of features, and my current design doesn't allow for some additional aspects that can help show off a game's charm!
